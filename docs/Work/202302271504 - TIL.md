## Generic Type Guards for Onboarding-toolkit
- The key is to make it as generic as possible. 
- The Step statuses are pre-defined as `ready | completed | error | disabled` . They are good for UserJourneyDrawer. Jemi still wants it to be even more generic to cater for future unforseeable usecases. So he made the default type for UserJourneyDrawer, `unknown`

## Support Qs
- Q: When working on the admin UI, is user protected routes sufficient for security?
	- There is no code hidden on the frontend side so user protected routes are for convenience purpose rather than for security purpose anyway
