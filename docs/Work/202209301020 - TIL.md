### Jest Debug: input type error?
- nothng looks wrong but get type error in the props and error messages like `{} ... not assignable, no methods filter, concat...etc` 
- most likely forgot to put the input params as a prop object into React function

### Jest Debug: "Unable to find role..."
- React-testing-library shows the current DOM on page when the assertion fails
- The strange thing is, although it complains `   TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an accessible element with the role "checkbox" and name Pages (3)`
- but the element is definitely shown as a list of the checkbox that react-testing-library can find...
- ok, the error happened in the `scree.debug()` line... if we don't use `screen.debug..`
#### Simplify and Make it dump as possible to pass
- Using full name text matching - the element can be found~!
- Problem in my regex..... `/Pages (\d.)/`
- it should be `/Pages \(\d\)/`  => parenthesis need to be escaped!!

### Jest Debug: Duplicate items set
- I think my complex test actually caught a bug yay!
- When setting state, my existing logic might have set duplicated objects in the state
- To avoid the duplication:
	- I was thinking of using `Set` or `Map` to force collection unique
	- Map -> array: spread operator `[...new Map().values()]`
	- array of object -> Map: 
	  ```
	  const kvArray = [[key1, val1],[key2, val2]]
	  const myMap = new Map(kvArray)
	  myMap.get('key1') // val1
	  ```
#### Make an array of objects unique
```
const transformedArray = myArray.map(obj=>[obj.key, obj.val])
const uniqueArray = [...new Map(transformedArray).values()]
```
#### Make the operation repeatable (generic function)
- Can be applied to different arrays repeatedly
- The function name makes the purpose descriptive, improves readability
```
const makeUniqueList = (myArray, key)=>{
	const newArray = myArray.map(obj=> [obj[key], obj])
	return [... new Map(newArray).values()]
}
```
#### Use TS generics in helper function!
- To pass a generic into an arrow function `<T>(input: T[]):T[] =>{}`
- Resolve the TS error by using its error msg expectations `was expecting... but received...`

### Jest Debug: on screen checked item is not the state!?
- checked using `screen.debug` for `getAllByRole('checkbox', { name: /My App/, checked: true })`  => only 1 elem shows up. It does not show the name or id..
- So check using `checked: false` and also only 1 elem shows up??
#### See what is rendered by test
- Purposely get an element not found on page, so that react-testing-library would print out the currently available elements to offer a glance
- Looks like the filter was not cleared previously?!
- update use `userEvent.clear()` and properly cleared input
