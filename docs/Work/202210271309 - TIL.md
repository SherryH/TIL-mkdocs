### React Types: JSX.Element, ReactNode, ReactElement
- JSX.Element extends from `ReactElement`
- `JSX.Element` is a `ReactElement` 
- functional component returns `ReactElement | null`
- class component render() returns `ReactNode`

### React.ComponentType
```
React.ComponentType<P> = React.FunctionComponent<P> | React.ClassComponent<P>
```


## Plan: Summary - multiaccount
- The Promise.all(saveAccounts) is done in a separate task ⏭ 
- Smartly UI - custom Header Accordion ✅
- UI - kinda ✅
- Use Mock data (billingEntities) for happy path ✅
- Fixed the validation so that user can proceed when 0 app page connected
	- => looks like a conscious change
	- => update copy? No. The Navigation button "skip" will be added later
 ### Edge Cases
 - 0 pages 0 apps. 0 Page to be checked later  ✅
 ### Fix Tests
 - Fixed broken tests 
 ### Fix Types (merge with billingEntities)
 - Before merging, get the types right, so that after merge, nothing more needs to change (next!!)☝️
