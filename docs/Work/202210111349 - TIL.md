### Routes Investigation
#### Currently `/pivottable`  is a redux page?
- Check if supply the same checks in `LocationIsSupportedRenderLEss` -> shows as a react-router route
#### Current company switch on /automation_feeds/:feedId/...setip
- Now that this is disabled
- After enabling it, switching company leads to "Not Found"
- Why?
- What makes /pivottable works?
##### Flow Observation
- When a company is switched, `navigateToANewCompany` is triggered with the `companyId` and the `routeId`
- In Automation_Feeds_SetUp, route, when changing route, it required `feedId` in the action payload too in `feedRouteActions.ts`, but we only supply `companyId` as we are changing the company. Instead of making the `routeId` to be the original `AUTOMATION_FEEDS_SETUP`, we want it to be the parent route `AUTOMATION_FEEDS`


### LiquidAutocomplete Investigation
- This [PR](https://github.com/smartlyio/smartly-ui/pull/3624) makes a change, which fixed their app issue but causes error:  `unstable_flushDiscreteUpdates: Cannot flush updates when React is already rendering` 
- This happens when we try to update the DOM before the component mounted
- ==Validation== example works when `useSize(textAreaRef)`
- ==Validation== example fails when `useSize(textAreaRef)`, but works `useSize(textAreaRef.current)`
- monkey patch solution: assign `required` to `isRequired` state inside `useEffect` to make sure it is set after component mounted!
#### Steps to Monkey Patch Solution
- Google errors and try to formulate reasons and solutions
- Document things tried and what doesn't work
- Wrtie a message to the team, about the progress and proposed solution etc
- ^ This is like rubber duck technique üê£
- Then.... Inspiration comes and ‚ú®
