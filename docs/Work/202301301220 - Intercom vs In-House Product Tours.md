# What are must haves for the solution?

- 

# Reflections
- It is so hard to understand. I understand the pros and cons of using either approach. However, I will not have the idea about how to do the research 
- I also read the slack [thread](https://smartlyio.slack.com/archives/C01V3EBGBFZ/p1674124944667989). When looking at the proposal, such as using Webhooks, or use the Intercom[ data-attribute-model](https://developers.intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference/the-data-attribute-model), I could not help but wanting to dig into > why Webhook is needed? What webhooks are offered by Intercom? How does the data-attribute-model play in the role of the Product Tour?
	- Is the `data-aatribute-model` the meta data on each tour? 
	- Where would other tour states, information saved?
	- Webhook: a way for an app to subscribe to another app
