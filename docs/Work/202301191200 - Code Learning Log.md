As a continuation of practice of directed self-learning of coding from [[202301141431 - æ–°å¹´æ–°å¸Œæœ› at work]], here is my attempt to keep a Q directed log to keep a record as well as stay focused.

## Evaluation of the previous attempt ðŸ˜†
### Objective
- I completed the original mini goal! 
- I did have a mental block ( in the ==initialFunc==  part where I struggled to create clean code to satisfy this requirement)
- I started on the second task!

### Reflective
ðŸ˜„
- I feel I managed the mental block well because I already told Kaia that I am gonna stay focused! (else I will prob just - try harder~ then got frustrated ðŸ˜‚)
- I did it by:
	1. Consciously wrote down an ugly working solution even tho i was unhappy with it
	2. instead of spending many hours thinking on my own, i wrote down the exact blocking points for me. 
	3. Then I looked at the solution and see how it works around the blocking points
	4. I coded the solution from memory
- Now I think about it after 2 days, I am actually proud of what I did!!
- This is a big change, and turns out to be effective! :D
#### Why was this effective?
- Setting a clear goal, 
- told Kaia about it to hold myself accountable, 
- being with family to have many distractions so it is easy for me to stop, 
- and write down notes so that I can clearly reflect!!
ðŸ™ƒ
- I still felt upset and stressed when I was wrapping up the 2nd task at 22:00 as I was hoping I could have done more ( although my goal was just to finish the 1st one)

#### Interpretative
- Talking to someone like Kaia about my goal to be small and focused was effective. Although I felt upset and unaccomplished not finishing the 2nd task but I did manage to stop. Looking back now, I am feeling proud :D
- Preping a short summary to Kaia before sleep - and I automatically put some positive perspective when I typed the message to her ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜‚ - the habit of appearing positive helps making me feel better!? ðŸ¤£
- Being on holiday and not stressed about my current work progress def helps a lot

#### Decision
- Always write a reflection and message to Kaia ðŸ˜‚
- Always write a clear goal, step by step - even when I think I remember what I wrote before - this helps priming my mind
