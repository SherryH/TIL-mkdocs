### This week (completed activities, notable wins, whatâ€™s working)
- Completed the Navigation redirections with Minna's help. DUPLO-1803 and DUPLO-1801
- Really got a chance to deep dive into the Smartly navigation setup using Angular, Redux and React Router routes. 

### Next priorities
- Meta Onboarding flow

### Challenges/Roadblocks
- I really struggled and it took me a long time to complete. I think it was also due to my lack of hands on knowledge in navigation, redux store and the APIs
- Really appreciate Minna's help and explanation to help unblock me

### Lessons Learned/Opps for improvement
- Many paths can be made into a redux route or a react route depending on how the navigation is done.
- only the routes saved inside `reactRouterRoutes` are navigated through react routes
- but, many redux routes are also under react router context and have access to `location = useLocation()`
- The redux are also under react router because in `js/routes/components`, the Redux Routes are mapped with their corresponding React Components and in `ReactRoot`, either a Redux route component or a React route component is rendered

#### How to navigate between Redux page and React pages?
- To Navigate to a Redux page, dispatch the actions
- To navigate to React Router page, use `navigate = useNavigate()`

#### Create a Redux Navigation
- Define the Route inside `js/routes/index.js`
- Add the component map into `js/routes/components`
- Navigate by dispatching actions
- ( Check the util methods available from `redux-first-router` )
- `state.location` stores information on path, action payload, action type
- `useSelector(getLocation())`

#### Create Reat Router Navigation
- Define a react Route `<Route element={<Component/>} />` and make sure it is placed under a Route inside `reactRouterRoutes` 
- navigate using `navigate = useNavigate()`

#### Type Driven Development
In a scenario, I would like to get the last segment of the url path
```
const viewedUserId: String = location.split('/').pop()  
```
![[Pasted image 20221024164601.png]]
- Because we know that  we can always get the userId from the path segment, but `split()` may return empty array `[]` in its definition
- `pop()` is a mutable method and TS doesn't support mutation. Any mutable object type must describe its properties as unions of all possible states the object could be in over its lifecycle
##### Define a NonEmptyType for the last element in array
```
type NonEmpty = T[] & [T]
```
##### Define a Type guard  with predicate for guarding the type as NonEmptyType
```
const isLastNonEmpty = <T,>(array:T[]):array is NonEmpty =>{
  // return array[array.length-1] !== undefined;
  return array.length > 0
}
```
##### Use the Type guard and NonEmpty type to assert that UserId is present
```
const isLast = (arrays: NonEmpty<T>) => {
  return arrays[array.length-1]
}

const array = location.split('/')
let userId;
if (isLastNonEmpty(array)){
  userId = isLast(array)
}
```
