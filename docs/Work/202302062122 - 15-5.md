## Chat with Minna:
### Tech Planning: Discovery
- Start with Component: Check if Smartly-UI can be reused
	- Check with design, see if we can reuse, extend an existing component or create a new one
- Start with API endpoints: Check if existing endpoints can be used
	- Github Search, we can also find out the team in charge. We can then know who to ping
- Key: Define a solid set of requirements

### How to implement?
- We do not need to provide implementation details in tech planning
- But, I may need to do a spike in order to know if something is doable or if my approach is reasonable
