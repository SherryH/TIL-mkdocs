### Tests for Navigation
- It is very very tricky - because to test the render/ redirect can involve the whole page...
- Mocking the page and component and debug is very very time consuming...
- I am glad that I made the decision to skip mocking for the 2 pages: Integration and Users after debugging with Jemi
- No wonder existing pages are tested with shallow mount..... The full mount required mocking in so many levels -> really time consuming and hard..
- Maybe discuss with Jemi about learning the internals of Jest testing library and the various mocking functions
#### Feel very tired and slow and incompetent
- I feel I am doing very slowly today.. I was hoping to finish the tests soon but never could.. and I thought I could help with picking up the copies but couldnt
- IT was like the lullaby language Weinberg mentioned...
- "I could get to it soon" => actually I bared finished my existing task at the end of the day... not to mention about picking up a new task - despite it may look simple
- e.g. I thought updating the CTA color would be super simple like a quick win, but no, the current LINKBUTTON does not have the color variant so it still needs to be discussed with the designers to extend the color variant..



TODO:
Write a brief summary for today
the react dom pages left out
thank you
sorry didn't get to do the copy

cya next week

Hello team,
sorry I only managed  to finish the CompanySelector PR today with the tests and did not get around to the copyâ€¦

In resolving issues with Jemi, we noticed that there are 2 pages (Users and Integrations) where the user does not get redirected to the Onboarding page when switching to an onboarding company. They will be redirected to Onboarding when they click on other pages. 
Somehow the ActiveCompanyContext returns old activeCompany instead of the new onboardingCompany - even though the right companyId is updated on the url.
Since it seems to be a rare case when this issue happens and it can be easily worked around, we decided to leave it out first. Just wanna confirm with you again @Pavlo it is ok!
