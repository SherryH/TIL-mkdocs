### Which Service is in charge of which Action?
#### Authorization
- In Generic Channel Config Wizard, the authorisation API is set in the `channelConfig.tsx` 
	- Pinterest: usePinterestAccounts
	- Snap, Tiktok: useAdAccounts > useCompanyAccountsFor => return the accounts already connected to platforms
		- `platform.authenticationUrl` => It is a property of PivotPlatform
#### Catalogs
##### Catalogs that were in Snap/ Tiktok but not connected to Smartly
- Get the information about these Catalogs using `Pena` (Tiktok, Snap)
- Pinterest don't have Catalogs
##### Catalogs that were already connected to Snap/ Tiktok
- Use `Snapper / Tikker` to connect and disconnect the catalogs
##### OrganisationAvailableCatalogs vs AvailableCatalogs
- in order to use hooks conditionally: 
	- if no organisation set up for company, render no catalog
	- else render catalogs connected to the organisation..
	- These are to do with the `Feeds API`, which uses  `Pena` services backend
	- `js/api/feeds` => We created this util for loading the Feeds API
	- It was never loaded or used in the frontend before!! A lot of leg work that we needed to do!
