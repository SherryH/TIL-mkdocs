Kick Off Notes
- Pavlo: Learn from Team Aether how User Invitation flow works
- Triggers and Budget Pool has a new designs. We need to estimate if we can help them next Quarter. We need to see how we can help them with creation experience instead of building the features for them
- Success Plan research: What success would become on the Home Page so we have better idea
- Tatu: more insights for Home Page and more times saved for Sales
- 2 aligns: Team Aether and Tatianna on Trigger n Budget Pool
- Strategy on Insights: put in stone this week
- Pavlo n Qianfei: put more widgets on Homepage. Q to work on other designers on Homepage and Tommi on Creative Insights
- Jemi:2 stories to ge things up. Then 1 story per story. Afterwards, backend stuff, depending on the requirements

#### Drawer Foundation URL
==My original Type definition==
- It is best to define from the smallest modules `JourneySteps` and compose all the way up to `visualisingReportSteps` 
```
const visualisingReportSteps: Record<string, DrawerStatus> = {
  openGraph: 'ready',
  selectColumn: 'disabled',
  adjustTime: 'disabled',
  selectSingleRow: 'disabled',
  toggleAllRows: 'disabled',
  changeDimension: 'disabled',
  changeGraphType: 'disabled',
};

const visualisingReportInitialState: State = {
  userJourneyId: 'visualisingReport',
  steps: visualisingReportSteps,
  expanded: true,
  selectedStepId: 'openGraph',
};

export type JourneySteps = keyof typeof visualisingReportSteps;
```

==Jemi recommended==
```
export type JourneySteps =
  | 'openGraph'
  | 'selectColumn'
  | 'adjustTime'
  | 'selectSingleRow'
  | 'toggleAllRows'
  | 'changeDimension'
  | 'changeGraphType';

export const visualisingReportSteps: Record<
  JourneySteps,
  UserJourneyStepStatus
> = {
  openGraph: 'ready',
  selectColumn: 'disabled',
  adjustTime: 'disabled',
  selectSingleRow: 'disabled',
  toggleAllRows: 'disabled',
  changeDimension: 'disabled',
  changeGraphType: 'disabled',
};
```

The reason is :
- By using `Record<string, DrawerStatus>` in my original definition, the `keyof` will narrow down the types into `string` instead of string literals. Unless in my original type dclaration, I declared the type as 
```
const visualisingReportSteps = {
  openGraph: 'ready',
  selectColumn: 'disabled',
  adjustTime: 'disabled',
  selectSingleRow: 'disabled',
  toggleAllRows: 'disabled',
  changeDimension: 'disabled',
  changeGraphType: 'disabled',
} satisfies Record<string, DrawerStatus>;

```
#### How is satisfies used?
- It is useful in the string literal union declarations 
- It can be used to find the exact matching type in the type union
- For instance, there is a type declaration for `Color`
```
type Color = string | {r: number, g: number, b: number}
```
- If we declare red color the way we normally do...
```
const red: Color = "red"
```
- The Typescript type inference will not be able to discern the type of `red` is a string in the build time 
```
// type casting

const green = "green" as Color
```
- Type Casting is not helpful here as it does not narrow down the type futher into a `string` in the build time. The type of green is still known as `Color` and TS is unable to suggest string methods when using green in code editor
```
const blue = "blue" satisfies Color
```
- Here TS checks whether type in the type union in `Color` satisfies the `blue` string, hence it knows blue satisfies `string` type in the type union in `Color` .
