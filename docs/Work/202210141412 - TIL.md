### Jest Mocking
- I had trouble making `jest.mock()` manual mock work....
- It was certainly mocking, but the mocked object was `undefined` ?
- so I forgot to add the return module name to the return!
```
// import * as FORWARD_PATHS from './forward.ts'

// undefined mock
jest.mock('./forward.ts',()=>({
  type:'type1',
  path: 'path1'
}))

// correct mock
jest.mock('./forward.ts', ()=>({
  FORWARD_PATHS: {
    type: 'type1',
    path: 'path1'
  }
}))

```

### Parse Dont Validate
- The [article](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/) is referenced by Hannu when he reasons against saving data in the localStorage and updates with versioning as it may cause the situation where things break in users computer only
- He proposed using zob for asserting the types while we save the sates in localStorage 
#### Main take aways
- Enforce the argument datatype. `f(x:T):V=>y`  Enforce `T` instead of doing lots of validation for the input. It makes code more efficient and performent.
- We can use tools like zob to make validators look like parsers and assert specific cases like `int: 1< x < 5` 
- Type Driven Design - push the respondibility of failure upwards to where the state types start narrowing down. Refer to [[202210131207 - TIL#Type Narrowing]] and [[202210101327 - 15-5#Beautiful Typescript]]

## Challenges
- Writing tests actually take a long time! esp mocking!!!
