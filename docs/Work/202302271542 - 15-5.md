### Best Practices
- Abstract code to keep in mind: Watch out for nested interaction! Nested Interaction is not semantically valid
- We decide on the information to include in the State based on whats essential, not because of ease of display
- Type Definition: Start from the smallest and compose into more complex ones
- Define 
```
// Define the basic data set as Tuple!
const journeySteps = ['openGraph', 'selectColumn'] as const

// Get Type from data
const JouneySteps = typeof journeySteps [number]

// 
```

### URL and Open Modal
- Either URL acts as the single source of truth to indicate the state that the modal is open
- OR the URL triggers the side effect to dispatch the action to open the modal. 

### Good Habits to retain
- Ask for fast feedbacks or book for meetings in advance so that I can have Qs clarified soooon
- Overall: Feels good this time! Approach:
	- Write tech plans and ask clarifying Qs
	- Spike first and get fast feedback for Qs within 1 day
	- Pair working on something new is also great!
