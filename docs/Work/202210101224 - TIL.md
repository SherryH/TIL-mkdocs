### TypeScript: Tuple for checking Array 
```
const connections:FacebookConnection[] = [{id, name, type..}, {}, {}...]

const getConnectionType = (connections: FacebookConnection[]) =>
  connections[0].type;

```
#### Get the connectionType
- We only need to access the 1st connection and check for the type
- We can have better type inference by making sure there is always at least 1 item in the connection and that item is of type FacebookConnection
##### Tuple: [FacebookConnection]
- The length of the array is defined
- The type of each element is known
##### Use Tuple with Array as our type for better inference!
- We don't know the length of connections, but we know there is at least 1 item
- `myType: [Tuple] & Array[]`
```
type ConnectionTypes = {
  filteredConnections: [FacebookConnection] & FacebookConnection[];
}

const getConnectionType = (connections: [FacebookConnection]) =>
  connections[0].type;

```

#### Display list: check connections.length > 0
- Before: `{connections.length > 0 && () }`
- After: Type Guard! `{isNonEmpty(connections) && ()}`
- `Type Predicate`  **A is B** returns a `boolean` 
- Type Predicate works with functions that return boolean and  helps control flow analysis
- Type Predicate tells TS the type of the inputs for output to be `truthy`
- In our case, for returning true, there must at least 1 item in the list so that the List needs to be of the form `[T] & T[]`
- Type Predicate is `list is [T] and T[]`
```
The type of isNonEmpty = (list: T[]) => boolean

The type of isNonEmpty = <T,>(list: T[]) => boolean

const isNonEmpty = <T,>(list:T[]):boolean => list.length > 0

const isNonEmpty = <T,>(list: T[]): list is [T] & T[] => list.length > 0 

```
