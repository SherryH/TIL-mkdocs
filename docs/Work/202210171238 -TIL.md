### Smartly Routes
- All the redux routes are included under `app.bootstrap.ts`
- `ReactRoots` wraps the components of some `redux` and `react-router` pages
- For the `redux` pages defined in `js/routes/index`, the corresponding components are displayed under `react-router-dom` . For these redux pages, they would evaluate to be `true` under the `useIsRouterContext()` check
	- These `redux` pages and `react-router` pages are contained under the `HashRouter` from `react-router` and can use the helper functions like `useLocation` to get the current path location
	- However, there is a limitation with `useParams` where these `redux` routes under `react-router` contex do not have  access to. These `redux routes inside react-router context` are placed inside the HashRouter, but they are not placed inside the `Route` components and therefore have no access to the dynamic params.
- In `CompanySelectorButton`, `useParams` is used so we need to differentiate the redux routes from the react-router-routes completely. So we use `useIsReactRouterRoute`
- In `RouterLocationIsSupportedRenderless`, we only use `useLocation` so we only need to differentiate the redux routes outside of context, so `useInRouterContext` is enough

#### Problems:
- I followed Minna's suggestions for user_settings page - as user_setting and company_setting pages can be found under `app.bootstrap.ts`
- They are angular routes and routed under redux - I think.
- `company.settings` and `userId` user settings pages have angular templates but not mapped to `js/routes/components` ReactComponents
- but only `Feeds For Automated Ads` page is included here. No Automation_Feeds pages.
- `AUTOMATION_FEEDS_LIBRARY` and `AUTOMATION_FEEDS` are actually the same page - they are React Components built using redux routes.
- So they do not appear under `app.bootstrap` at all as they are not angular pages and routes anyway.
#### My Solution
- I could verify the redirection `userId -> setting` using `app.bootstrap.ts` and remove it from `FORWARD_PATHS` object
- However, we still need to keep `FORWARD_ROUTES` for automation_feeds pages ...?

### Smartly Routes Redirection
- For our redirection routes: editUserPanel `:userId` and automationFeed `feeds/:feedsId/setup`

#### EditUserPanel
- editUserPanel is an Angular route. It is defined under `app.bootstrap.ts`, it has a template/ controller defined
##### Move from Angular route to redux route
- It was already a React component connected with redux state and hooked to angular route as an interface
- To remove the angular dependency: remove it from root and component `app.bootstrap` and `ui.bootstrap`
- Remove the `smartlyReactBridge` from the `EditUserPanel` component
- Add it to the routes Element Maps in `js/routes/components`
- The redux routes and components are not placed under react-router `<Route>` but they are all present under `HashRouter` inside `ReactRoot.tsx`
##### Move from redux route to react route
- 
- 

#### AutomationFeeds
- It is a redux route. 
- Almost all redux routes are under `react-router context` if they are defined  
- Create the redirection in the redux thunk: check the location: companyId, feedId. If `!feedId` then redirect to the parent route
