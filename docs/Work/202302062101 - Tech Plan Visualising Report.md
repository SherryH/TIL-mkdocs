## Current Status
- Wrote a list of Qs to clarify in order to have clear requirements
- Waiting for Pavlo to give answers to proceed
## What next?
- Usually I would wait for requirements to be ready, then create a list of tasks...
### What can I do now?
- I want to spike first, see if it is achievable
- Then I have a better idea to create sensible tickets, in vertical slices
- Make reasonable assumptions, allow for easy change when Pavlo answered requirements

### What are the reasonable assumptions?
- We create a button to load the visualisation user journey
- 7 Steps in total ( including the sub steps)
- No need to go back
- Auto move forward by clicking the right button

### Goal: 
1. In Frontend, create a button to load the 7 step visualisation in the Reporting page, beside the "TableViewWithGraph" button
