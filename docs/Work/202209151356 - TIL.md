### Understand API by reading OpenAPI yaml
- Understanding the current API capabilities/ constraints in the Tech Discovery would help designers design executable features, and reduce the rework, rediscussion effort
#### How to read OpenAPI?
- Github Org search for the used services for the backend repo
- e.g. for the Meta API, we can check [Correos OpenAPI.yaml](https://github.com/smartlyio/correos/blob/master/openapi/openapi.yml#L776)
- In line 776, we see adAccount schema definition
- In line [2178](https://github.com/smartlyio/correos/blob/master/openapi/openapi.yml#L2178), we see the actual request [paths](https://github.com/smartlyio/correos/blob/master/openapi/openapi.yml#L966) and signatures
- line 1378 - create connections
- line 1242 - patch accounts - but no connections?

### Encourage thorough tests - smaller tasks
- Tests would be more thorough if the tasks are smaller. Even if the story seems simple, before we start coding, think through
- Split into task that can be done in 1 day, include tests!

### Lead and Managers
- Process has issues but when I am in for long, sometimes i don't see them
- Or, I am still learning, struggling with the tech stuff so harder to see the process picture
#### The Pain is there, how to induce change?
- Lead tech planning is painful. Hannu stressed the importance of 
- There are more aspect to it. Jemi's doc explains very nicely
##### How can we come up with a list like this?
- What do we need after tech planning? => API signature
- After planning, people start working on the tickets. What Qs might people have?
	- Which ticket can other engineers work on following planning?

### CSS - The Divider height % doesn't work
- works in px but not in %. 
- => All its parents, grandparents, great grandparents etc have to have `height = 100%`!

## Reflection (Feeling)
- A little overwhelmed. so much to learn in every PR!
- Need to focus!

### Tests Mocking is not straight forward

#### Mock the Internal Method
- I wanted to mock the internal method in React => but actually I should just mock the API call
- Mocking the API call,=>  mock the `get` method
- Import the whole package and mock the whole package
- For mock data, use Factory to build 
```
jest.mock('../../js/lib/api', () => jest.fn());
api.get = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(companies); 

// lint complains about updating app.get

```
- We can also mock single function using `spyOn`
```
let mockGet;
beforeAll(() => {
  mockGet = jest.spyOn(api, 'get');
  mockGet.mockResolvedValue(companies);
});

afterAll(() => {
  mockGet.mockRestore();
});
```

- It is super difficule to implement mocking like: ❌
```
jest.mock('../../js/lib/api',()=>{
  return({
    get: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(companies)
  })
})
```
#### jest.mock always failed. prob cos 'hoisting' issue?

#### Reference mockData inside jest.mock
- use jest.spyOn!

### Debug: Test Mocking successful, why not rendered in test?
- The props are all passed in correcly - mocking worked successfully!
- because eslint errors? => no, did a simple return and the expected "test" is rendered

```
if (true) {return <div>test</div>}
```

- Tried hardcoding the button text: "Test Test" => rendered ok
- => it was originally undefined. only in the second render that it showed
- => update the assertion to wait for 2nd render!
- issue: use `findByText`  (getBy + waitFor), asked to handle promise...
- `const elem = await screen.findBy....`
- `expect(elem).toBeInTheDocument`
