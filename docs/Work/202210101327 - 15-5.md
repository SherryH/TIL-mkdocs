### This week (completed activities, notable wins, whatâ€™s working)
- Major refactoring of the ConnectionSelection screen
- Sleek code thanks for Jemi's help

### Next priorities
- Merge ConnectionSelection screen
- Navigation routes redirection

### Challenges/Roadblocks
- Refactoring is taking a lot longer than I expected
- Lots of test failures to troubleshoot along the way - which also take sometime

### Lessons Learned/Opps for improvement
- Much better code 
#### Coding Loop
- Write simple stupid, duplicated code and fullfill functional requirements
- Write tests covering all comprehensive scenarios
- Refactor
- Check Types
#### Refactor Tips
##### Start from root: Single Source of Truth
- Check data and ensure there is only 1 state and others derived from it
##### Effective Updaters
- Update resolvers so that setters can receive prevState to do functional updates like `setStateActions`
##### Colocate logics and UIs
- Derive the specific states in the component with UI
- When making changes in future - logics and UI are together!
##### Beautiful functions
- Give inner logics descriptive function names
- If it seems hard to extract inner logics into functions, adjust conditionals
- Place conditionals where it is easy to extract out inner callback functions
#### Map: How to make an array of objects unique?
- every item in a `Map` is unique
- Format the objects suitable to be put into a Map
```
new Map ([[key, value], [key, value]])

// object {id, type, name} -> [key, value]
// usually
newArray = myArray.map(obj => [id, obj] ) 

new Map(newArray) 

```
#### Set: How to check if an array contains an item?
```
.include(), .some(), .filter() all work

.has() from a Set also works

mySet = new Set (myArray.map( ({id}) => id))
mySet.has(item.id)
```

#### How to use a hook conditionally?
- Don't
- If must, wrap it inside a component

##### Beautiful Typescript
- `Paramters<P>` returns an array of params of function type `P`
- `new Map()` takes an argument of `Iterable<readonly[string, T]>`
- type guard with a combined type of tuple and array `[L] & L[]` can be used to better verify common conditions like `items.length > 0`
```
isNonEmpty = (list: L[]): list is [L] & L[] = list.length > 0

```
- Negative comparisons like `a!==b` can be extracted out of functions - make functions better composable
```
.filter(a=>a!==b)
.filter(negate(compare(a))) // more descriptive!
```
