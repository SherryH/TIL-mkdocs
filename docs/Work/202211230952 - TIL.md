### Misc
- Routes doe not work well in Mono repo: ask in the engineering chat []

### CompanySelector Feature Planning
- This seems like a smaller feature not too hard to plan
- There is a great benefit of sharing the intended approach first 
	- Write on Google doc
	- Look through the code and identify the existing services and modules that can be reused
	- How the code can be structured to create the feature
	- AND => Minna was able to give me suggestions to make the redirection happen on the Onboarding page instead of in the CampanySelector component!
