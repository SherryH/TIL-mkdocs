### Debug Jest - why text not showing up?
See  [[202209151356 - TIL#Debug Test Mocking successful why not rendered in test]]

### Debug CSS - Adding Icon screwed up alignment
- Original horional alignment of text becomes misaligned after adding Icon
- Margin and paddings are added for Icon so it is not squashed, but still misaligned
- the `height` of the text comes different
- Orignally they were both 20, after adding Icon, height becomes 24
- Change Icon Size to be small so that Icon height is 20px!
