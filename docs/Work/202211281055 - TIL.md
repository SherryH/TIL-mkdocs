### Navigation Jest Test
#### Debug misunderstanding!
- All React Components are rendered. E.g. every `<Route/>` children are rendered. The log `I should log` will always be logged even though the path is `/companies` ! 
- The children components are all run and rendered into elements
- Only the one matching the path would be mounted
```
  const TestComp = () => {
    console.log('i should log');
    return <div>I am root</div>;
  };
```

  - The whole functional component is like the render mthod in a calss component. see [here](https://reacttraining.com/blog/mount-vs-render/)
 ##### Check if a component is mounted under a Router
 - Checking console.log from the component shown is NOT good indication => all children Routes get rendered anyway
 - Testing using a simple Test component to check for the rendering route!
##### Warning message is not the real issue
- I kept getting the console warning `No routes matched location "/" ` and suspected something may be wrong with the renderWithRouter helper.
- It was a warning, NOT an ERROR! so not the influencer!!

### UseEffect compare companyId
- the root cause for my test failure was that the `useEffect` hook I created for redirection was run onMount as well. 
- In the test, when the component was mounted, because the useEffect hook is also run and user gets redirected straight-away...
- When I test it in manual testing, this Onboarding page was run and re-rendered multiple times and - my hypothesis is that, even though it may be redirected initially, other states change make the component re-render, and the useEffect hook is not run on rerender. 
- Best way to make it safe is to still do a check inside the useEffect is using `usePrevious` to compare the companyId again. Not just rely on the dependency check to prevent it from running in the beginning onMount.

### Assertion for test
#### For async Promises
- findByText returns a promise. Sometimes in Jest test we may need to wait a bit for the assertion and we can use `findByText`
- `resolves.not.toBeNull()` == `toBeInTheDocument()`
```
await expect(
      screen.findByText('Make your Ads Smarter')
    ).resolves.not.toBeNull();
```
