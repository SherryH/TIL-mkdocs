## What I learnt today
- Always consider ==Value== first
- Avoid adhoc tasks. 
### Scenario
- Priya wants some research done on the libraries we could use for achiving drag-drop grids
- I was not sure how to assess pros and cons as we were not given any further specific criteria
- I was also easily persuaded to undertake the tasks and timebox it
	- I was thinking, there are 3 libraries listed already. I can maybe look into the reviews and do a high level checkout of these libraries, their ratings, API conplexity etc and write a brief overview.
- I liked Minna's way better - She pushed back this task as there is no clear criteria / use case requirements
	1. it is an adhoc task and we have no visibility as to why this is urgent that we need to change our current work
	2. there is no clear criteria by which we can evaluate the libraries with. This feels like a waste of effort
	3. She suggests alternatives like asking in the `ask-frontend` channel to check if someone has done something similar - it was great that Hannu pops in and expressed his concerns about the lack of specific usecase and decided to hop in the decision of locking into one library at this point of time
- As software engineers, we need to deliver the ==values== . 
- Don't be afraid to push back and ask for clarification before agreeing to undertake the work
- So that we can provide REAL values for the company!! :D


## Jemi
- Apply the abstract concepts to things I know well - e.g. React components / coding kata
- Write tests enumeratively: with precondions and actions and results
- Jemi recommended Dave Farley's Youtube channel 
### Ask Jemi Next Time
- I was thinking of using RemedaJS (TS version of Ramda) as TS kata 
- but each function seems really complicated and relied on different support methods. 
- How do I simplify it to be a TS kata that I can get started with??
