## Contextual Helper
### Strange: closePopover does not work in Contextual Helper
- The usePopover gives out `closePopover` method, which, inside Popover component dispatches Popover Actions to close Popover menu
- However, when using the `closePopover` method in the Contextual Helper, the Popover component does not close as expected ...

### Strange
#### Possibly the batch state transition issue 
- so my second hook `useContextualHelper` does not get the updated value `isHelperOpen` from the first hook
- What happened was that, there were 2 renders, 
- 1st render, `isHelperOpenInitial: true, isHelperOpen: false`
- 2nd render, adfter isHelperOpen is updated, it should be passed into `useContextualHelper` 

``` js

const isHelperOpenInitial =
    useUserJourney(VISUALISING_REPORT_ID)?.selectedStepId === 'changeDimension';
  const [isHelperOpen, setIsHelperOpen] = React.useState(isHelperOpenInitial);
  if (isHelperOpenInitial) {
  // when isHelperOpenInitial is true, isHelperOpen is still false...
    debugger;
  }
  // can move this line back into component
  const { contextualHelperProps } = useContextualHelper({
    isOpen: isHelperOpen,
  });```
