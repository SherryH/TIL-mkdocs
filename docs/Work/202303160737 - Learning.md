## What I want
- I want to be able to write good code like the Drawer Redux state management or Generic Wizard like Jemi did

## What does it comprise of?
- Understanding of the code structure, why certain design decisions are made
- The structure of each component and file and their relationships
- Have testability in mind 
- Typescript for geneic util functions
- Clean, reusable code for achieving certain purpose

## What do I want to be able to do now?
- Combine some learning of structure of design and coding
- Can quickly explain with some diagrams about the designs of the Generic Wizard components and the code structure
- The coding styles enabling this abstraction 
- and the Typescript typing needed to achieve this

### Some design concerns
- Some of the platforms have very similar APIs and the Onboarding structure. In order to not repeat the code
	- 1. We can create Platform agnostic Onboarding Wizard, where we use the same Wizard component for each of the platforms 
	- Pros: We can reuse the Platform agnostic Onboarding Wizard on all platforms, including future new Platforms and just supply them with their own specific congifuration files. It makes future development of new Wizards for new platforms easy
	- Cons: The
