#### Review the Authenticator Visual PR
- 25min
	- 5 min: hypothesis
	- 10 min: read PR, write notes
	- 10min: note the diff 
##### If it were me, how would I approach?
- Read the existing component
- Note the behaviours: props (input), renders (output: for identity is present, identity not present and error) and the inner functions
### TIL
#### UserTokenAuthenticator
- SUI Message components: We can supply a styled Link component as description
- BaseButton looks like a link!

#### Icon Sharing URL
- Save the search text into the URL hash
	- `decodeURLComponent` => decode into human readable form
	- `top.window.location.hash` => to get the hash of the url 
	- `top.window` is actually `window.top.window` where the global object `window` is the global `this` and is omitted. 
- `searchInput` is already used as text for filtering
- we can syncrhonise it with the hash in url
- `searchInput`  is set to equal to the url hash `#/search=(.*)` by  default
- when `searchInput` is updated, url hash is also updated
	- useEffect to update the url hash whenever `searchInput` is changed 
- when the icon page is mounted, get the url hash and set `searchInput` to be the url hash
	- `useEffect`, when hash changes, set the `searchInput`
	- `topWindow.addEventListener('hashchange', updateSearch);`
##### To enable Icon Sharing
- `const setSearchInHash => void`  - set the url hash search param to be searchInput (encoded!)
- `const parseSearchFromHash =>decodeURIComponent(hash.match(/search=(.*)))` - set the hash URL into human readable form
- `useEffect(()=>{},[searchInput])`  - 1 useEffect to set the url hash to be searchInput 
- `useEffect(()=>{},[])` - another useEffect to set the searchInput to be url hash. To listen for url hash change, `top.window.addEventListener('hashchange', updateSearch)`  where updateSearch = setSearchInput(parseSearchFromHash).
