### Save Meta Accounts
- Need to call a `POST` request for saving the Meta Accounts.
- `correos` API created some fancy interfaces for which I can see the examples for `GET` but not `POST`
- `correos` API bascially: 
	- `fetchEndPoint` enriches and executes the `endpoint` API passed into it
	- `correos.client.account(accountId).get` or `correos.client.account.post` ...etc all of these are defined in `oat-client.generated.ts`
