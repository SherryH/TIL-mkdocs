### Bundle Size Bloated
- My PR somehow has this BundleSize Bloated issue
- ![[Pasted image 20221101140751.png]]
- Rebase with latest master and run the build again - same issue
- Googled and checked codebase, use `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to check the master and my branch bundle size
	- Install `webpack-bundle-analyzer` cli and generate the stats file 
	- `pnpm webpack --profile --json > stats.json`  pnpm is like npx so i don't need to install `webpack` separately
#### My Plan of attack
- I could not get `webpack-bundle-analyzer` working properly
- Looking at the code and Den's suggestion, the most suspicious culprit is my pump up of the Accordion package... even though that updated change was so minimal too...
- I was thinking of isolating the problematic commit by either `git-bisect` or just try the most suspicious import first
- ^BUT, Minna had an even better idea...... => Merge the import of Accordion package as a separate branch!! 
- It is possible that something went wrong uring the build process and bloated the bundle. Split the commit would be the ideal way to enable the merge!
