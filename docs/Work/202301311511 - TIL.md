## Ask Smartly-UI
### Select
- Lots of tech debt, usually we help by suggesting workarounds using[ `useCombobox` ](https://ui.smartly.io/?path=/docs/hooks-usecombobox--basic)
### Tooltip
- it works by passing the ref into the children via forwardRef. If a child does not accept child (e.g. old Select), we can workaround by wrapping it with `div`
### Popover Overlay
- Hmm trying to understand the problem identified in the [thread](https://smartlyio.slack.com/archives/C013H9HFV7G/p1674455937098809)..
- Q: So it is by design for the overlap or any elements to bubble up to parents, and up to the applications to stop the event propagation?
