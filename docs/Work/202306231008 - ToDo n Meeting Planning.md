### Brain Storm for Monday Meeting
- I had a big rant with Andrey, Jemi and Pavlo. Pavlo was great in reminding me that
	- We need to pick our own battles
	- Count our arsenals and define strategies and 
	- carry them out and pivot
- He shared stories about his experiences in choosing when to hop for the next one
- What he had hoped to have done differently : maybe stay in the battle until the end 
- What he sees in a good manager - the middle management who has direct contact with the executors and also the senior management
- The senior management can sometimes lose perspectives of the severity of the issues when they hear report problems all the time - because they don't know whether it is getting even more serious and people start losing passions
- The senior management are all capable people. When they work as a team, they need to cooperate and communicate and make hard decisions and compromise. It is not easy, even for experienced and smart people. Everyone has own ego and opinions.
- He thinks, inspiring people and motivate people via intrinsic motivation is far more important
	- start with WHY and
	- make people feel that they contribute to the idea / decide on the direction that you (mgmt) wanna go e.g. with the case of going back to the office
	- DS update : e.g. start with problem definition within the team, share blog articles etc to plant seeds of thoughts
- I got really motivated!! apart from complaining - there is perhaps something we can do within our control to shape the environment that we would like to work in!
	- He helps me recognise I have more resources at my disposal
		- e.g. I can go with Andrey to his meetings to compliment his lack of FE knowledge?
	- I can do something about it other than waiting for a new tech lead!
- Yes! That totally escaped my mind. Andrey needed help. I know he is in an awkward position being the manager representing us to the meetings without the FE knowledge. but I didn't think of doing anything about it because it was outside of my responsibility. Seeing from the whole team's perspective where we lacked product leadership and technical leadership, maybe with our power combined, we can do something about it together!

### My frustration
#### No Vision from Team Duplo
- Lack of leadership to steer the direction formulate what we, the Duplo Team sees and wants for the DS. Getting the design and just do what was told - is not very inspiring. 
- I can do that, but it does not feel right. 
	- e.g. when working on the color alias, i remember theme - is it important? what use case will it be used? if we gonna incorporate the theme, is there any ground work we gonna do in advance together?
	- ALSO, I didn't pay too much attention thinking about release and adoption. Because the management is going to put that as a priority for adoption. They will do it. I don't feel I own it so I didn't dive in the details as I expect others like Ron they probably have thought about it. If there are problems with teams migrating to SUI v5 or v6, then they need to figure it out. But then, actually Team Duplo is implementing it so we will need to help troubleshoot those issues 
- We may not have all the answers immediately to provide designs with the feedback straight away in the meeting, but 
- Was there no attempts of delivering the values or visions?
	- yes there were attempts, like they did in the fancy ppt
	- It didn't click or inspire or make me feel included at all
#### Ineffective Communication
- We have been having regular weekly meeting with Angelos and Daily everyday
- But we still had this huge misalignment
	- what the release should look like
	- what is needed before we start development in order to have release confidence 
- Something annoys me
	- We start doing investigation on what design wants without knowing why
	- e.g. Design decided that we are going to start a whole new DS without considering technical feasibility and now we have 2 UI Kits and SmartlyUI from Dev does not match with UI Kit from Design.
	- We may not know enough to make the right technical call, we make mistakes, at least we as a team thought and discusses about it together and made our best attempt
- Something that made me uneasy
	- What kind of issues we might encounter after the migration? (by reading the code I can't yet tell what the impact may look like)
	- How much effort is it likely to take to have it resolved?

### How to open the discussion
- "I had a big rant in retro. I had another big rant with Andrey and Pavlo last week. I am not someone who likes complain. I don't complain often, but this time I have been complaining quite a bit and feeling very frustrated working on DS. So I would like to have this conversations with you. Pavlo was very good that he inspired me to realise that, maybe there is something within our capability that we can do about it"
- "Here I think, perhaps we can have a dialogue. I was ranting a lot but in retro but I think not everyone was in a retro mode as it was also a team day preparing for events. I want to hear what you guys were thinking too."
- 
- I was frustrated due to lack of Vision from Team Duplo, Ineffective Communication
- I also have expectations that were not met. 

- "I feel our meetings are not effective. I feel we need to have more conversations. Not Meetings. e.g. I have expectations for Andrey as team lead, but I believe he is also struggling."

- I wonder, if we can change our meeting format so that we can notice and align the 
- If there is one thing that you could change about Daily format, what would it be?


- Share the problems that I see at the moment
- Engage others to speak what problems they experience or if they feel the same way?
- Some changes we can implement 
	- Ask 1 Kaizen problem: what would be the one thing that you wish could be different? What can we do about it together?
