# Hannu: Improve tests
- Slack thread: Reduce flaky tests!!
	- Treat warning like errors! No console warnings!
	- Common flaky tests: 
		- async effects not cleaned up (not returned in useEffect. So try accessing the async response after the compound unmount)
		- not use fake timers in tests where app uses timers (e.g. Date)
		- network requests not mocked
```
Warning: An update to SomeComponent inside a test was not wrapped in act(…).
When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(…):
```
	
 - Solution
		- [treat console warning as error](https://www.benmvp.com/blog/catch-warnings-jest-tests/). no console warnings [jest-fail-on-console](https://github.com/ValentinH/jest-fail-on-console)
		- mock on unmocked tests: msw can mock all requests. and we can use it to [catch unmocked requests in tests](https://github.com/smartlyio/frontend/blob/master/packages/google-campaign-management/test/utils/mswTestUtils.ts)
- Track
	- Hannu has this excellent idea of collecting a set of tests that has uncaught network requests / write console errors/warnings - instead of failing these tests directly
	- Makes it easier to refactor and track the improvement

# Drawer Component
- Only 1 Drawer open at one time
	- Define what is a drawer
		- My initial assumption is that only our Onboarding Drawer is The Drawer. But then, the super long Bulk Edit can also be a drawer
		- Always clarify assumption
	- If we only want 1 open, we need to know if there is another open at the same time
		- Save the state in context to be shared!!
- Place the drawer whereever they want
	- Let them anchor somewhere!
- Direction of the tooltip!

# Where to get Navigate usage stats?
- To help Editors to see whether implementing main navigation provides value to customers
- Is there another way to better implement the breakout pattern?
	- My guess: Sentry to get data?
		- What event? Dashboard URL?
	- => Pavlo: Segment, available on Tableau: `navigated_using_hub` event, `navigated using search`, `navigated without search`. The adoption percentage is over `smartly app visit`
	- slack [thread](https://smartlyio.slack.com/archives/C01V3EBGBFZ/p1674563693964129), [Navigation Hub Adoption Analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FdJeflckva4RlR4X_oPmAnXO750yTLOD3OSnoiJKaR0/edit)
