### Better typing for React Routes and Redux Routes
- Improved the type definition for `FORWARD_PATHS` object
- Intead of `originalPath = RouteName | string` => which is essentially just a string
- Do more concrete typing like
```
type ReduxPath = {
  type: 'redux';
  originalPath: RouteName;
  forwardPath: RouteName;
};

type ReactRouterPath = {
  type: 'react-router';
  originalPath: string;
  forwardPath: string;
};

type ForwardPathType = ReduxPath | ReactRouterPath;

export const FORWARD_PATHS: ForwardPathType[] = [
```

### Type Narrowing 
- companyRoute flows down from many many levels above, takes the type `string | undefined | null`
- In our component, we know the companyRoute belongs to `Routes` enum. e.g. `Routes.AUTOMATION`, `Routes.CAMPAIGN` ... and the type is of `RouteNames`
- To narrow down the companyRoute type in our component, I wrote a type guard
```
const isCompanyRouteRedux = (
  companyRoute: string | undefined | null
): companyRoute is RouteName => !!companyRoute && companyRoute in Routes;

// use this inside component
  if (!isCompanyRouteRedux(companyRoute)) {
    throw new TypeError(`Wrong redux path passed in: ${companyRoute}`);
  }
```
