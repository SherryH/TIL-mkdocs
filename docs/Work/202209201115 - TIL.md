### Smartly App forever loading
```
rm -rf ~/Library/pnpm

pnpm store prune

// in root of monorepo
rm -rf packages/*/dist
rm -rd packages/*/node_moduules

// in packages/frontend
pnpm install --force
pnpm build
```
- I tried all the usual drills but it still stayed in the forever loading screen
- Switching to `Incognito` mode finally worked and showed errors in the consoles
- Clearing cache and cookies still didn't work
- => maybe try a hard refresh next time?
- => Remove potential ==chrome extensions==!!!

### CSS: make text input width 100%
- inside the modal, without changing the width of the company, how to make it grow to align with other siblings?
- Wrapper around everything and set width=100% on wrapper!

### Levels of abstraction
- An abstraction can be a shortform of expressioning a group of other things
- It can be 1 concept that can be used to express 2 other concepts
- e.g. `map` + `access property` => `pluck` . Pluck is an abstraction
- Inside my JSX array.map, for each individual `company`, I am computing `accountNumberPerCompany` and derive `plural('account',accountNumberPerCompany)` 
- Those can be extracted out into a separate component 
- => Single Responsibility of the component

### TS helps code design
- When typing gets too ugly, it is a sign that code design is not right
- Just like when test gets too hard, it is a sign that code smells
- In my `CompanySelector`, I have a generic `SearchFilter`, for which I created a default filter function for filtering through the companies when used in the `CompanySelector` . The filter function can also be replaced by other functions when needed
- There is type incompatibility after assigning types to `defaultFilterFunction` and `SearchFilter`  because `SearchFilter` types are more general, more generic than `defaultFilterFunction`, which was designed for `CompanySelector`.
- The `defaultFilterFunction` should not be default. It should be passed in to `SearchFilter` when used inside `CompanySelector` for which it was created.
- ðŸ¤¯ TS typing can help improving code design because of the different levels of generics in the functions!

### Good Convention - callback
- When pass in [state, setState], make the callback prop name as `onStateChange` or `onStateClick`  depending on the listener
- Name the callback as the callback, instead of state setter 

### Good Convention  - show/hide component
- A component itself should not care about whether it will show/ hide
- that is controlled from the parent
