## Planning Meeting
- I liked Minna's suggestions and proposals
	- We should have a tech planning involving all engineers togethers before giving Andrey the estimation
	- We should dedicate a time block for doing the planning work together instead of getting people to do planning in an adhoc manner 
	- How to roll out the token changes to the whole frontend app?
		- I first just thought it is Angelos job for talking to other teams to make sure they check the code the update places etc. It was noy our business <- ==this kind of mentality limited me so that I didn't think deeper about the ways where the integration work could be carried out so that it is easy for teams to check and Angelos to follow up== -> even though it may not be our day to day responsibility, but we can still help and make a significant impact by making the process smoother 
		- The development branch approach does make a lot of sense!
		- Next time: I can word my response in a way that takes more ownership - "It is up to Angelos to push the teams to check and update the colors as they can give some pressure from the company direction. We can make the dev branch and get the dev environment ready for them to check and push the changes in." <- mention what we can do to make the process better!
- I still suck as estimation. Thanks Minna for the feedback and I should disect the ticket so that they finish in 1-2days
