### useCallback
- Event handler passed into Child, Child would always re-render everytime Parent re-renders even if Child has no other props or states change
- => because, Child always receives a new version of event Handler prop from Parent whenever Parent re-renders
- To make Child only re-renders when there is a real value change in the props, we can wrap eventHandler in useCallback for referential equality
#### Wehn to use useCallback
- When this function is to be exported from context and used in multiple places
- When the function is a dependency to other hooks (e.g. useEffect)
- When the function has some internal state e.g. throttle or debounced
