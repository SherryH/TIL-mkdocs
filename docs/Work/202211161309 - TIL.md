### Hero Feature Recommendor Planning
#### DUPLO's focus is on Onboarding
- Onboarding is essentially to enable the user to easily access to various features in Smartly
- and Guide them to setup and accomplish their goal, enable them to see the improvements in their ads and sales 
- To ==easily access to various features==:
	  - URL links to various feature pages
	  - Examples:
		  - Set up automated ads on Meta
		  - Set up Reporting on Snap
	  - States to consider:
		  - ActiveCompany, platforms, adAccounts connected, user permissions, 
	##### How would an user see a feature?
	1. the feature is available in a platform
		1. Automated Ads is only available in Meta
	2. the adAccount is connected to the platform 
		1. PlatformAndAccountSelector shows up in the NavigationHub
	3. if feature is featuregated, user can see if he/she is in the featuregated TA
	4. user role has the permission
		1. Redux store > userPermissions: Gives an array of the roles the user has in a company
		2. An user can have multiple roles

	##### To easily access a feature - useNavigate
	- This hook takes in the `actionConfig`, `companyId`, `platform` . The actionConfig maps the platform with the available feature (route). 
	- The output is the route data and `hasRouteData`, tells whether this route (feature) is available in hte given company and platform
	##### To easily access a feature - Toolkit
	- Create a Smartly UI like kit for teams to use and contribute to the Hero Feature Onboarding


#### Future Best Practice
- There is legacy in the code which we need to keep in mind when planning for future
- In Stage 1 release, reusing the existing code is the most cost effective approach
- We should still keep in mind of the future upgrade option/ plan
##### User Permission
- UserPermission information is available in the redux store
- We want to remove the dependencies towards redux. If we need to keep in mind of the future development plan
	- Deep Dive in Slack, Confluence pages and Google docs

### Error Handling Planning
- Error state does require proper planning to show meaningful messages to the users and provide sensible next step!
#### Onboarding Wizard Error Handling
- There are many cases that we should consider
	- Errors for each of the platforms: Meta, Pinterest, Snap..
	- Errors given at different points in Server Side: 
		- Platform rejects
			- FB rejects
			- v1 rejects
		- Database rejects
##### What Error Messages should we provide to users?
- The goal here is to connect adAccounts to platforms
- Potential Results: 
	- Success
	- Failed to connect all adAccounts
	- Failed to connect some adAccounts
- User don't really care if the errors come from FB or v1 or DB
- What we want to do
	- If error, tell user which accounts failed to connect
	- The error messages from backend associated to these failed accounts
##### How to show the Error Messages
- Dialogue Modal or Banner
- Redirection to an Error page
##### What next steps do we suggest to the users?
- Explicit instruction on what user needs to do to complete her goal
- Right redirection: back to the First Step to start again?
- retry: retry callback()
##### Logging
- Send analytics
- Error logging
#### ErrorBoundary Util
- SmartlyUI has a ErrorBoundary component!
