## Reflection
- The whole morning is gone: had a meeting with Jemi, review and investigate and change based Minna's comments
- I felt happy after booking the meeting time with Minna! => Feels not urgent or necessary but once I do I feel I can learn more and forseeable faster progress!
- I feel stressed when unsure of mocking the `userMetaAdAccountReducer`. it returns the state which I just wanted to mock the adAccounts.
	- => Ask Jemi's approach
	- => check other examples. Instead of using `MetaAdAccountContextProvider` mocking reducer, just `<MetaAdAccountContext.Provider` and pass in the state

## Priorities

	- current tests 2.5h âœ…
