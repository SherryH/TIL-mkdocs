## What is Big O?
It signifies the maximum time (upper bound) required to reach a solution using the algorithm. => describes the **efficiency** of the algorithm!
O(1) signifies that the time required is constant. 
O(n) signifies that the time required grows linearly as the number of inputs into the algorithm increases.

To reach a good solution, usually it is a trade-off between time/ space required. 

## Q: How do we use Big O to assess the complexity of common algorithms like search?

### Big O time (Time Complexity)
#### Is O(1) better than O(n)?
Generally yes. 
Note It also depends on the input size. If Input size is small for certain, O(n) algorithm can perform better.

#### Best Case, Worst Case, Expected Cases
They have no direct relationships with Big O, Big Omega, Big Theta.
The Base/Worst/Expected cases describe the complexities O for **a particular set of inputs**.

**Best / Worst / Expected cases** -> `t = f(n)` describes a given input size, `n`

**Big O, Omega, Theta** -> derivatives. describe the rate of growth, `â–³`

Omega, Î© -> Lower bound

Theta, Î˜-> Aymptotically Tight bound. Asymptotical: matters only for large values of `n`, tight bound: nailed the running time between a upper/lower bound. `Î˜(f(n))` (bound limit) includes `O(f(n))` (upper bound) but not vice versa.

### Big O space (Space Complexity)
1D Array - O(n)
2D Array - O(2n) 
Note: We usually drop the constant when using Big O to describe complexity because depends on the context and the actual computation, O(2n) is not necessary less efficient than O(n).

#### Recursive calls
Recursive calls stack up and take up the memories until it is finally executed. It typically requires more memory than using a for loop.  

#### Loop
Looping usually adds to the time complexity but not space complexity. When variables are created in the loop, they exist only for that round. The calls do not exist simultaneously on the call stack.

## Examples
### Î˜(1)
- E.g. Going through a sorted array to find the minimum value. 
- It will always take constant time as n `â†‘`
- Î˜(n<sup>0</sup>)  -> Î˜(1)
- The `rate of growth` in running time as n `â†‘` has a constant factor, 1

## Terminology
### Call Stack
Call stack is a stack data structure for holding information on the running subroutines in the computer program.
