# No SQL vs SQL
## No SQL
- High growth, rapid development, schema likely to change
- Make best use cloud storage. Cassandra is optimised for storing across different data centers. lower cost, fast access, high availability
- The dataset has little structure

## SQL
- ACID compliance - data integrity
- data is structured, unchanging

# Reliability & Redundancy
- high availability = lots replica
- redundancy = no single point of failure
