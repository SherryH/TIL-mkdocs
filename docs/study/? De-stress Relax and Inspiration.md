## Observative
- I have been feeling stressed subconsciously, in the background. It seems I am feeling I am learning too slow again, with so many thing I don't know and I have not yet started coding challenge practices... 

- I have not been able to look at a complex app and know how to make it straightaway, in autopilot mode, like drawing app, DnD, make poo rain, animation, auth login etc
## Reflective
- Stressful, not wanting to do other things like laundry, vacumming
- procrastinating other things like giving away monitor even though it is not hard
- ==Relaxed== after reading a touching story of kids showing reciprocity and appreaciation upon receiving help from the teacher! Made me ==happy, warm and relaxed!==
## Interpretive
- ==Story telling== is super powerful. Changed my mood, my motivation and removed my stress!!!!!
- This is the right way to do ==affirmation== and ==visualisation== everyday!
## Decisional
- Try to read these stories before going to bed. Tech free time - read stories to relax!
- Try reading 青春微素養，相遇到療癒，諮商與輔導，張老師 ，==feel== the story!
