## Important
Remember Semantics!!
Create Components with meaningful semantics like `ul`, `li`,`a` .
Make good use of `<ChakraElem as="ui" >`.


## Chakra UI css vs sx
Chakra UI enables us to style using Tailwind like utilities.
To style some more complex cases, e.g. `&:hover{}` which Chakra allows us to style `css` directly through `css` from `@emotion` and `sx`.

### @emotion css
Chakra UI uses emotion under the hood and we can use @emotion css to conditionally apply styles like 
``` js
import { css } from '@emotion/react';

const hoverCss = css`
  &:focus, &:hover, &:active {
  	cursor: pointer;
  }
`  

const ABox = ({ disabled }) =>{
  return <Flex css={[!disabled && hoverCss]} />
}


```

### sx
Chakra UI also provides `sx` as another escape hatch.
One +ve point for using `sx` is that we can ==access Chakra Theme for colors==.
We can compose css together in `sx` by spreading different css objects!
``` js
export const disabledCssObj = {
  "&:hover,&:active,&:focus": {
	cursor: "default",
  },
  color: "gray.100",
};

<Icon sx={disabled && { ...disabledCssObj}} />
```

## Responsive Styles
By default, Chakra supports responsive styles using array syntax
``` css
<Box bg="red.200" w={[300, 400, 560]}> This is a box </Box>
```
Some components don't support responsive values.. e.g. Avatar.
The current solution @2021 Apr is to use [`useBreakpointValue`](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/1028)

## Apply Chakra Button Styles to a Link
`useStyleConfig`!
See [this discussion thread](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/3722) and [this documentation](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/component-style#usestyleconfig-api).

## Pass the rest props for Link to work!

Ans: because we need to pass the `ref` further down to `<Tag/>`!!
