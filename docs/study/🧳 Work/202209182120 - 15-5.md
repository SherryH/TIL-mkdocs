### This week (completed activities, notable wins, what’s working)
- Completed Summary page
- Understood the Nested Routes with Outlet that Hannu improved on, with mini codesandbox
- Understand Jest mocking better: `mock`, `jest.fn`, `spyOn`, it can significant reduce the time I spent in mocking 
### Next week’s priorities
- Understand Jemi's PRs, maybe do a mini codesandbox
- Finish the first Company Switcher ticket
- Help with the 2nd Company Switcher ticket
### Challenges/Roadblocks
- I wish I can work on tickets faster 
- Understanding Jemi's PR would take some effort. I may not have the energy to get to it after work
- 
### Lessons Learned/Opps for improvement
- Jemi's Technical Story Planning doc is helpful. I wonder next time,  what Qs we can ask to make finer improvements?
