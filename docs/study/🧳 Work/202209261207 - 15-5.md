### This week (completed activities, notable wins, what’s working)
- Finished company selector UI
- Rules on decompose components:
	- levels of abstraction > 2
	- Move the corresponding hook and the corresponding JSX closer

### Next week’s priorities
- Release CompanySelector GA
- Complete the Nested Checkbox list for Meta Onboarding Pages&Apps

### Challenges/Roadblocks
- Hard to keep on top of all slack threads

### Lessons Learned/Opps for improvement
- When env stopped working and tried the restart dance, and only working in Incognito mode - Chrome extension may be the culprit!
- "Onboarding" flow can be a confusing/ over loaded term as our "Onboarding" period is 90 days. Maybe rename as "PreOnboarding" 
- Domain:
	- Currently the list of adAccounts is associated with the company, not with the authoriser
	- By BE providing the authoriser SmartlyUserId, we can filter and show only the current user authorised adaccounts in the Onboarding
- Routing
	- React-Router-Dom
		- Get the current company and account Id from URL
		- `navigate(newLocation)`
		- To check the current page is react-router-dom `isInRouterContext && !hasReduxRoute`
	- rdux-first-route
		- Hard to get the companyId and accountId from URL. They are in the store
		- We need to use selector to get the current page route `useSelector(getLocation)`
		- To navigate, we dispatch actions to the new route with `useDispatch` and action  `{type: Route.PAGENAME, payload: {companyId, accountId} }`
