### Domain - Onboarding Ad Account List 
- To connect to all or some of the available ad accounts under the Business Manager that the authoriser has access to, it is done in the proprietary modal (Snap, Tiktok etc)
- So the Ad Account list is just the accounts that user has connected with, under the chosen company
- 1 Ad Accound can only be connected with 1 Smartly User even though multiple platform authorizers can have the access to the ad account on the platform
- In the Proprietary modal, after 1 ad account has been connected with an authorizer, it cannot be connected with another authorizer
#### Why we need a SmartlyUserId for account returned?
- So that we can filter accounts according to the currentUserId === smartlyUserId (authorizer's smartly id) ie. currentUser is the authorizer
- Else all the accounts of the company get returned. Some may be authorized by other people and we are not interested in those in the current onboarding steps. (We just wanna see the ones we just connected in the proprietary modal!)

### UseSelector
- In Redux, a `selector` maps `state` to `props` and passed into the components
- `useSelector` subscribes to the redux store, and runs the `selector` whenever an `action` is dispatched

### Redux-First Router Navigation
- On the new react-router-dom pages, navigation to  is simple as we just need to 

### React-Router-Dom
- The URL confines to the format `/company/:companyId/account/:accoundId` 
- Company scoped and Account scoped URL makes it easy to navigate, by changing account or companies on the URL with `useNavigate` and `navigate(newLocation)` 
- To check the current page is react-router-dom `isInRouterContext && !hasReduxRoute`

### Redux First Router
- we can not get the companyId or account id from the path
- We can get the Redux RouteId (current page route) from `useSelector(getLocation)`
- To navigate, `useDispatch`, pass in `{type: Route.PAGENAME, payload: {companyId, accountId} }` etc
