### What is most important?
Trust
- only with trust, I am able to say what I think. Promote changes and ask many many Qs without feeling ashamed
- Ask Qs takes lots of courage. Trust helps

### What was not good?
- Super Long PR review process
	- prob cos I was working on DS alone. and Now on Account Selector
### What did I do?
- Raised this issue in Retro
- Own the action item to discuss and improve it in another meeting
- Thought of the methods that I thought that could improve as potential proposals. BUT, opened the meeting by __Explaining Context__ from my experience.
- Then opened the table for people to share their experience and suggestions.
- Trust the team. They are all capable people. 
- The final decisions were not what I thought of originally, but they kinda served the same purpose so it was good!

### What is slowing me down?
- **Read other peoples PR**
	- Don't really understand...?
	- Like reading a book! 
		- Write hypothesis of how it works
		- Draw diagrams + write notes while reviewing!
### What steps can I take next?
- Go through the past Support slack threads and identify the patterns
